                            In the city where innovation flowed through their veins, four young entrepreneurs named Werik Jahel, Hesnan Ávila, Walber Ruthierre, and Fabrício Souza stood out. They were dedicated students at the Federal Institute of Sergipe, passionate about technology and determined to make their mark on the world.

                            One day, during an entrepreneurship class, the idea of creating something grandiose emerged: a technology-focused business group named W2HF. Each letter represented one of the founders. Excited, they decided to expand the idea and establish an e-commerce platform, iTec.

                            iTec was born from the desire to offer the most innovative and recent technologies to everyone, from gamers to scientists, from students to entrepreneurs. Werik, the visionary, envisioned an intuitive and easy-to-use website where customers could explore a vast catalog of innovative products. Hesnan, the strategist, outlined plans for efficient logistics, ensuring that each product reached buyers quickly. Walber, the natural communicator, took care of social media and the growing community, while Fabrício, the technology expert, supervised product quality.

                            Together, they faced challenges and overcame obstacles. Initially, iTec was a dream, but with determination, hard work, and collaboration, it became a reality. The reputation of iTec grew, and in no time, the name W2HF became synonymous with innovation and trust. The business group thrived, and its brand gained global recognition. And so, the journey of W2HF and iTec continued, with the four friends united by their love for technology and the desire to make the digital world more accessible to all.
